# Question 
Using the AddTwo program from the textbook in section 3.2 as a reference, write an Assembly program the
calculate the expression below using registers.
##### A = (A + B) â€“ (C + D)
Define data for values 
##### A, B, C and D as valA, valB, valC and valD
respectively with initial value of
##### 4000h, 5000h, 3000h, 2500h respectively.
Also,
##### valA, valB, valC and valD are all 32-bits integer variables.
##### Assign valA to EAX, valB to EBX, valC to ECX and valD to EDX.
Make sure that your data type can match up nicely to each of the said registers.
Then make sure you do the calculation for the expression above correctly.
Lastly, show a dump of your registers when finished.
