# Microsoft Macro Assembler

## Set Up
#### This will mainly consist of screenshots as a reminder tutorial on setting up a Windows environment to program in MASM. 
I learned to program in MASM using the Assembly Language for x86 Processors textbook, 8th edition, which Kip Irvine wrote.   
Kip Irvine also has a website with many resources in it.
Below are links to his website and different tutorials for setting up Visual Studios environment.

### **Side Note**
I will admit I only used Visual Studio 2019 while reading the textbook. So this tutorial will only be for setting up the Visual Studio 2019 environment, but I feel that it will also be helpful if someone is setting up Visual Studio 2022.
